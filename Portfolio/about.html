        <p id="p">My name is German Jimenez, I was born in L.A in 2002. I moved to up to the Bay Area to Oakland in 2008. Here in Oakland and in the Bay I have learned alot and have grown up here this has really changed me and made me into the person I am. On my free time I enjoy to play video games, work out and play with my dog. I attend Life Academy of Health and Bioscience in Oakland,CA.  </p>
